## World Building Toool

### The point
The point of this website is to help with worldbuilding. The tool keeps track of trade routes and these variables therein:
- Resources that traverse the road
- How long it takes for a shipment to traverse the road
- Dangers along the road
- Average losses of resources

The trade routes are algorithmically generated and account for:
- Difficulty in terrain, trade routes prefer to traverse flat dry land or oceans instead of rocky mountains
- Species prefrences to terrain, if a species are very quick to traverse a specific type of terrain they will prefer to use it as a trade route.

Cities and other tradehubs have export and import needs, farmers wonuldn't be buying grain or selling bricks.

### The how
Pathfinding, hexagonal terrain generation, Dijkstra's algroithm
